I am an auto-driving preception algorithm engineer in the Department of Auto Driving at the [Xiaomi Auto](https://www.xiaomiev.com/). My research focuses on robotics and perception. I am particularly interested in developing intelligent systems that can perceive and reason about their environment to make autonomous decisions.

Prior to my career in Xiaomi Auto, I earned a [Master of Science in Computer Science](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/degree-programs/master-science-computer-science) from the [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/) in 2023.  During my master's program, I specialized in machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms, with a particular focus on robotics, computer vision, and portable machine learning system. My research projects were primarily centered on the intersection of artificial intelligence algorithms and distributed system. I worked with [Dr. Mengmeng Liu](https://faculty.gtsi.edu.cn/en/node/3137) to apply machine learning methods to object detection under crowded scenes for urban planning. In addition, I worked as an research intern for [Huawei Group](https://www.huawei.com/cn/) to research on clock algorithm(mainly used in WIFI and network communication&&synchronization).  


I also have experience working for startup. Since graduating from [Harbin Engineering University](https://www.hrbeu.edu.cn/) with a bachelor's degree, I have worked as an algorithm engineer and manager in [Changsha Qizhen Technology Co.,Ltd](https://www.lockdoor.net/). We are dedicated to develope a E-seal system that works to lockdown unlawful property, vehicle. Our work is widely adopted by courts, transportation polices and ministry of emergency.
